/*
	--~~== SEQUENCE FILE FORMAT ==~~--
This is a SEQUENCE file. It's used to give actors in the scene stage directions.

The syntax for directions is similar to that of code, so it should be familiar. 
	There is one difference though, you don't need to escape characters in dialog. i.e. use " instead of \"
	Comments are also supported. Both block and single line

	--~~== SUPPORTED STAGE DIRECTIONS ==~~--

moveToSpike( int actor_index, int spike_index, int movement_time )
- Moves the actor at actor_index to the spike at spike_index over movement_time ms
- NOTE: If I we can get the actors to move like NPCs in the cutscenes then I can remove movement_time

speakLine( int actor_index, string dialog, int word_time )
- Makes the actor at actor_index speak dialog. Speaking time will last word_time * number of words in dialog ms
- Each call to speakLine will produce a new speech bubble. If dialog contains multiple lines, they will all be contained in a single bubble

delay( int delay )
- Will do nothing for delay milliseconds

shake( int shake_time )
- Will shake the screen for shake_time milliseconds

camToSpike( int spike_index, int movement_time )
- Moves the scene camera to the spike at spike_index over movement_time ms

camZoom( float orthographic_scale, int zoom_time )
- Changes the orthographic_scale of the camera (it's zoom) over zoom_time ms
