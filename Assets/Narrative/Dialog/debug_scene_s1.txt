/*
	--~~== SEQUENCE FILE FORMAT ==~~--
This is a SEQUENCE file. It's used to give actors in the scene stage directions.

The syntax for directions is similar to that of code, so it should be familiar. 
	There is one difference though, you don't need to escape characters in dialog. i.e. use " instead of \"
	Comments are also supported. Both block and single line

	--~~== SUPPORTED STAGE DIRECTIONS ==~~--

moveToSpike( actor_index, spike_index, movement_time )
- Moves the actor at actor_index to the spike at spike_index over movement_time ms
- NOTE: If I we can get the actors to move like NPCs in the cutscenes then I can remove movement_time

speakLine( actor_index, dialog )
- Makes the actor at actor_index speak dialog
- Each call to speakLine will produce a new speech bubble. If dialog contains multiple lines, they will all be contained in a single bubble

delay( delay )
- Will do nothing for delay milliseconds

shake( shake_time )
- Will shake the screen for shake_time milliseconds

camToSpike( spike_index, movement_time )
- Moves the scene camera to the spike at spike_index over movement_time ms

camZoom( orthographic_scale, zoom_time )
- Changes the orthographic_scale of the camera (it's zoom) over zoom_time ms
